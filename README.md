An online tool for 3D viewing of [TrackML challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification) particle collision events. Alternative to [official tool](https://emoyse.web.cern.ch/emoyse/WebEventDisplay/jsdisplay_TrackML.html).

Advantages (compared to official tool):

* Filtering by particle_id or particle index.
* Viewing particle origins (so called vertex), initial momentum vectors, particle trajectory.
* particle trajectory calculated from initial parameters (e.g. magnetic field strength, initial particle position, initial particle momentum, particle charge).
This will help to cross check the single particle parameters fitting.
